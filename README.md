# MachineLearningR
Use various machine learning methods in R to examine and manipulate several data sets

Make sure data sets are installed in R before trying to run.  Check the working directory if you are having trouble with the installation process.  Use various built in R functions to manipulate the data sets such as mean, head, tail, str, etc.  Then create graphs and find relationships between different collumns of the data.

Past the first 3 data set code blocks, we dive deeper into the data using R functions like decision trees, neural networks, naive bayes, linear regression, and knn to train and test our machine learning as to how accurately they can predict target variables.
